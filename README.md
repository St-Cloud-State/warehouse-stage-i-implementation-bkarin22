# Warehouse (CSCI 430 Stage 1 Implementation)

## Overview
We utilized gradle/junit to accomplish the unit testing of our project, however for my individual submission I simplified the project structure and only uploaded the source code and testing files in the src and test directories respectively for reference. 

## Unit Testing
The gradle test result files are located under the unit tests directory.
As Ryan and Myself completed most of the unit tests together I uploaded the results for all test classes. 

## Integration Testing
The end-to-end testing script files are located under the integration_testing directory.
